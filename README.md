# blastr
Your interstellar frontend component framework ğŸš€
![build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/CorentynDevPro/blastr/ci.yml?branch=main)

## ğŸš€ Getting Started

This project uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io) as its package manager and monorepo workspace manager.

### Why `pnpm`?

Blastr is a modular project with multiple interconnected packages. `pnpm` provides:

- ğŸ“¦ Faster & disk-efficient dependency installation
- ğŸ”’ Strict dependency isolation (no undeclared packages used silently)
- ğŸš€ Native monorepo support (workspaces)
- ğŸ§  Better tooling (`pnpm why`, `pnpm recursive`, etc.)

To install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```
